# Halo-model
Python code for minimal halo model as presented in my thesis.

Code is still not completely bug free and here and there are some hardcoded values, that for now, should not be changed. The simplest way to run it, is to run halo.model function from halo.py

It REQUIRES hmf package (with CAMB) for calculating halo mass function and linear power spectrum. See more at: http://hmf.icrar.org or https://github.com/steven-murray/hmf This piece of code works with hmf version 1.7.0
